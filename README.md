Thanks for visting! I am a political sociologist studying the intersection of crime, bureaucracy, and social policy using computational and qualitative methods. Right now, I am a data justice post-doctoral fellow at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern University, working with the [Complexity and Society Lab](https://brennanklein.com/and-lab) and the [Institute for Policing, Incarceration, and Public Safety](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/policing-incarceration-and-public-safety) at Harvard University to expand available national data sources on the criminal legal system and approach existing data in creative ways. I am also a visiting fellow at the [Harvard Department of Sociology](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/). I recieved my PhD in sociology from [the University of California, Berkeley](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/) in 2025.

My dissertation and current book project investigates efforts to cultivate community-based violence prevention projects in California since 1990. Through fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, 72 interviews, and extensive archival research, I show how a rigid system of competitive nonprofit contracting emerged and consolidated to make it increasingly easy for cities to experiment with new approaches to public safety, but difficult for their proponents to institutionalize them. In doing so, I draw out the interrelations of state and street violence, the role of nonprofits in the modern American state, and the challenges of criminal justice reform for both advocates on the ground and theorists of the penal state.  

I have published a number of papers on bureaucratic decision making and policy reform with more on the way, using parole boards as the primary case. Some of this work looks at how the reasons for granting or denying parole change over time. This includes a paper on [how old rehabilitative ideas become new again](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/i-come-before-you-a-changed-man-insight-compliance-and-refurbishing-penal-practice-in-california/C08B2D845DB27DB46DF1DEEFD2C656F8) and ( with [Brendon McConnell](https://brendonmcconnell.github.io/)) [how parole commissioners respond to externally-imposed changes](http://brendonmcconnell.github.io/pdf/parole_ML.pdf).  Another set of papers (with [Joss Greene](https://josstgreene.com/)) inquires into how criminal justice administrators adjudicate culpability and regulate freedom. This work highlights [the categorical fluidity of individuals up for parole](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11186-023-09523-6), the [racialized gender tropes that commissioners mobilize to justify their decisions](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362480620910222), and [the symbolic value of incarcerated labor](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14624745251320357). Across all my work, I am interested in the implications of changes in policy for reducing social inequality and creating a fairer criminal legal system.

I am also currently at work on a paper that probes justifications for police violence (with [Sandra Smith](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/sandra-susan-smith) and [Jaqueline Lepe](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/jaqueline-lepe)), and one that asks about the relationship between conceptions of community and the nonprofit as a legal and organizational form.
