Thanks for visiting my site! I am a data justice post-doctoral fellow at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern University, working with the [Complexity and Society Lab](https://brennanklein.com/and-lab) and the [Institute for Policing, Incarceration, and Public Safety](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/policing-incarceration-and-public-safety) at Harvard University to expand available national data sources on the criminal legal system and approach existing data in creative ways. I am also a visiting fellow at the [Harvard Department of Sociology](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/).

My research investigates the challenges of criminal justice reform, various forms of state and street violence, the gears of administrative decision-making, and the role of nonprofits in contemporary American political life. I blend traditional qualitative methods, such as interviewing, ethnography, and archival work with emerging computational approaches to text-as-data. These various strands merge in my dissertation research and current book project, where I investigate attempts to cultiave community-based violence prevention efforts in California over the last several decades.

I have published a number of works on parole boards and have more projects underway. Some of this work looks at how the reasons for granting or denying parole change over time. This includes a paper on [how old rehabilitative ideas become new again](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/i-come-before-you-a-changed-man-insight-compliance-and-refurbishing-penal-practice-in-california/C08B2D845DB27DB46DF1DEEFD2C656F8) and [how parole commissioners respond to externally-imposed changes](http://brendonmcconnell.github.io/pdf/parole_ML.pdf). Another set of papers shows what parole hearings reveal about how criminal justice administrators adjudicate culpability and regulate freedom (highlighting [the categorical fluidity of individuals up for parole](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11186-023-09523-6), the [racialized gender tropes that commissioners mobilize to justify their decisions](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362480620910222), and [the symbolic value of incarcerated labor](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14624745251320357)). Across all, I am interested in the implications for inequality and the possibilities of reform. 

I am also currently at work on a paper that probe justifications for police violence, and one that asks about the relationship between conceptions of community and the nonprofit form.
