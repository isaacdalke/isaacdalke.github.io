Thanks for visiting! My name is Isaac Dalke I am a data justice post-doctoral fellow at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern University, working with the [Complexity and Society Lab](https://brennanklein.com/and-lab) and the [Institute for Policing, Incarceration, and Public Safety](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/policing-incarceration-and-public-safety) at Harvard University to expand available national data sources on the criminal legal system and approach existing data in creative ways. I am also a visiting fellow at the [Harvard Department of Sociology](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/). I recieved my PhD in Sociology from [the University of California, Berkeley](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/) in the summer of 2025.




My research investigates the challenges of criminal justice reform, the interrelations of state and street violence, the gears of administrative decision-making, and the role of nonprofits in contemporary American political life. I blend traditional qualitative methods, such as interviewing, ethnography, and archival work with emerging computational approaches to text-as-data. These various strands merge in my dissertation research and current book project, where I investigate attempts to cultivate community-based violence prevention efforts in California over the last several decades. I show how a rigid system of competitive nonprofit contracting emerged and consolidated to make it increasingly easy to experiment with new approaches to public safety beyond policing, but difficult to fully institutionalize them.

I have also published a number of papers on parole boards, with more on the way. Some of this work looks at how the reasons for granting or denying parole change over time. This includes a paper on [how old rehabilitative ideas become new again](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/i-come-before-you-a-changed-man-insight-compliance-and-refurbishing-penal-practice-in-california/C08B2D845DB27DB46DF1DEEFD2C656F8) and [how parole commissioners respond to externally-imposed changes](http://brendonmcconnell.github.io/pdf/parole_ML.pdf). (The second is with [Brendon McConnell](https://brendonmcconnell.github.io/).) Another set of papers with [Joss Greene](https://josstgreene.com/) inquires into how criminal justice administrators adjudicate culpability and regulate freedom. This work highlights [the categorical fluidity of individuals up for parole](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11186-023-09523-6), the [racialized gender tropes that commissioners mobilize to justify their decisions](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362480620910222), and [the symbolic value of incarcerated labor](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14624745251320357). Across all, I am interested in the implications for inequality and the possibilities of reform. 

I am also currently at work on a paper that probes justifications for police violence (with [Sandra Smith](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/sandra-susan-smith) and [Jaqueline Lepe](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/jaqueline-lepe)), and one that asks about the relationship between conceptions of community and the nonprofit as a legal and organizational form.
